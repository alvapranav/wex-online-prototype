![WEX IQ Dashboard](/public/wex-dashboard-preview.png)

This prototype demonstrates a futuristic vision of the WEX Online platform, reimagined for 2025 and beyond. The application integrates advanced AI assistance, real-time fleet management, and interactive financial controls in a seamless, conversation-driven interface.

## Key Features

### WEX IQ - AI Assistant
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction with an AI assistant that understands fleet management context and user needs
- **Voice Interaction**: Full speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities for hands-free operation
- **Real-time Transcription**: Live transcription of user speech for immediate feedback
- **Contextual Understanding**: The assistant maintains conversation context and can reference previous interactions

### Interactive UI Components
- **In-Chat UI Elements**: Interactive components like purchase controls and statement summaries appear directly within the conversation flow
- **Dynamic Purchase Controls**: Adjust spending limits, location restrictions, and time periods with intuitive controls
- **Statement Management**: View and interact with financial statements without leaving the conversation context

### Fleet Management Dashboard
- **Real-time Activity Monitoring**: Track fleet activity, spending, and transaction history
- **Transaction Insights**: Visual breakdowns of spending patterns and category distributions
- **Proactive Alerts**: Get notified about unusual spending, maintenance needs, and optimization opportunities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and React
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Realtime API for voice and conversation capabilities
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for application state
- **UI Components**: Custom components built with accessibility in mind

## Setup

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file
- Start the development server with `npm run dev`
- Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to experience the prototype

## User Experience

### Dashboard Overview
The main dashboard provides a comprehensive view of fleet operations, with cards for quick access to key metrics and recent activity. The sidebar navigation allows users to access different sections of the application.

### WEX IQ Assistant
The AI assistant is accessible through a chat window that can be toggled from any screen. Users can interact with WEX IQ through:
- Text input
- Voice commands (with real-time transcription)
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### Interactive Features

#### Purchase Controls
Users can create and manage purchase control profiles with:
- Date range selection via an interactive calendar
- Location and radius settings with autofill capabilities
- Spending limits adjustable through an intuitive slider
- Category selection for permitted purchase types

#### Statement Management
The statement summary interface provides:
- Visual breakdown of spending by category
- Savings highlights and opportunities
- Quick access to payment options
- Downloadable statement formats

## Agent Configuration

The WEX IQ assistant is powered by a sophisticated agent system defined in `src/app/agentConfigs/wexAgents.ts`. The agent is configured to:

- Understand fleet management terminology and concepts
- Provide contextual assistance based on user role and permissions
- Trigger appropriate UI components based on conversation context
- Handle complex queries about transactions, spending patterns, and account management

The agent can be customized further by modifying its configuration and adding specialized tools for specific fleet management tasks.

## Future Roadmap

This prototype represents an initial vision for the future of WEX Online. Planned enhancements include:

- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered forecasting of fuel prices and spending patterns
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Intelligent maintenance recommendations based on vehicle usage patterns
- **Enhanced Authorization Controls**: More granular control over purchase authorizations with multi-factor approval workflows
- **Mobile Companion App**: Synchronized experience between desktop and mobile interfaces
- **AR/VR Integration**: Immersive data visualization for complex fleet analytics
